# Frontend Instructions

Use this guide for frontend work in the project.

It uses Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, and Framer Motion.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy. Write everything that is needed.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever the user asks for.

## Guidelines

- Always use the hooks from @/hooks/use-toast to show toasts.


## Steps

- All new components should go in `/components` and be named like `example-component.tsx` unless otherwise specified
- All new pages go in `/app`

## Reminders

- We use the Next.js 14 app router
- Try and group components into folders
- use shadcn/ui for all ui components located at `components/ui`.
- Client components need 'use client' at the top of the file. So anytime you use useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, etc. you need to use 'use client' at the top of the file.
- Do not create any new components folders, just use the existing one.
